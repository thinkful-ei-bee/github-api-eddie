Github API User Search Web App

The user can search for a GitHub user handle.

The search will trigger a call to GitHub's API.

The repos associated with that handle is displayed on the page.

The page displays the repo name and link to the repo URL.

The user is able to make multiple searches and see only the results for the current search.
